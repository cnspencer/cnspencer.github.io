<h1>About Spencer Studios</h1>
<p>Spencer Studios is a low budget film company founded by a pair of sisters. The Studios frequently partners with <a href="paulproductions.html">Paul Productions</a> to create movies such as their most infamous series <a href="https://youtu.be/mByQ61IYcyo"><i>Angelic Journey</i></a>. Rumours are abounding about another partnership in yet another franchise but both companies have confirmed nothing. However, the Studios has announced that a portion of the music in whatever they do next will be composed specifically for it.</p>
<p>Despite their huge talent and fame on <a href="https://youtu.be/j92U0UkD6RY">YouTube</a>, they are a virtually invisible company.</p>
<p>To remain in budget, most music is from royalty-free artist <a href="incompetech.com/">Kevin MacLeod.</a> Their fan Youtube channel is also run by founder CNSpencer.</a></p>
